# Ansible
Collection of Ansible playbooks I've created and then adapted to be shared publicly.

I'm still learning Ansible and have only used it to help me solve issues in my day to day role as this is how I find it easiest to learn, when I have a problem to solve.

They likely won't be the most efficent or cleanest playbooks you'll see, but by the time I've put them up here they will be working for me internally so feel to let me know how they can be improved up.
